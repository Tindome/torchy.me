Conway's Law - Conway's Law, that states that "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies
of the communication structures of these organizations", keeps appearing in unexpected places. One of the key tenets of the Agile Manifesto
 is "People over Processes and Tools", and we see Conway's Law reinforcing this idea both negatively and positively. Some companies are mired
 in siloed structures that add needless friction to engineering efforts, while more enlightened companies use team organization to drive the kinds
  of architectures they want. We're learning the peril of ignoring Conway's Law and the benefits of leveraging it.

La loi de Conway établi que "les organisations sont contraintes de produire des élements qui sont des copies des structures de communication de ces organisations".
Pour empirique qu'elle soit cette loi, m'amène a extrapoler sur le thème suivant. Si les RSE sont la solution au problème de
communication et de partage de l'information d'une organisation, le fait que le RSE soit porté par les organes structurant cette organisation aboutira à un outil qui continuera de faire emprirer une situation

.... a developper
